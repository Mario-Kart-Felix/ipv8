This module has all of the original py-ipv8 payloads in it to be put into packets and sent in a way such that py-ipv8 can interpret what we are sending.

Modules
binmemberauthenticationpayload	The BinMemberAuthenticationPayload module contains the structs and methods necessary for representing serializing and deserializing BinMemberAuthenticationPayloads
connectiontype	Represents the type of connection two communities have.
introductionrequestpayload	Module containg the IntroductionRequestPayload relevant code
introductionresponsepayload	Sent by the base Community to start a direct connection between two Peers
puncturepayload	Payload sent by the receiver of a PunctureRequestPayload to actually puncture a hole (NAT puncturing)
puncturerequestpayload	Payload sent before performing NAT puncturing
timedistributionpayload	Send as a part of most Packets to drive the Lamport clock
Traits
Ipv8Payload	Used to recognize payloads. Does not have any members yet, (though already useful as a marker trait).
