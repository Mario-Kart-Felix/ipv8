1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,690
So let, let, let, let me ask you, um, the
rules you have are not based in US law,

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:06,450
right? US law doesn't recognize
restrictions on hate speech.

3
00:00:06,451 --> 00:00:07,410
It's considered free speech.

4
00:00:07,411 --> 00:00:09,630
So if you want to stand on a street
corner and yell the craziest things in the

5
00:00:09,631 --> 00:00:12,870
world, you're allowed to on your
platform, Twitter, you're not allowed to.

6
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:17,670
So even in that sense alone, your
rules do have an ideology behind them.

7
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:20,880
I don't completely disagree. I think,
you know, I don't want harassment. Um,

8
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:25,170
but the reason I bring this up is getting
into the discussion about democratic

9
00:00:25,171 --> 00:00:28,180
health of a nation.
So I think it's,

10
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:31,950
it can't be disputed at this point
that Twitter is extremely powerful in

11
00:00:31,951 --> 00:00:33,990
influencing elections. You know, I,

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,900
I'm pretty sure you guys published
recently a bunch of tweets from foreign

13
00:00:36,901 --> 00:00:38,730
actors that were trying
to mettle in elections.

14
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:41,910
So even you as a company recognize
that foreign entities are trying to

15
00:00:41,911 --> 00:00:44,450
manipulate people using
this platform. So I, I,

16
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:46,140
there's a few things I
want to ask beyond this,

17
00:00:46,141 --> 00:00:51,060
but if wouldn't it be important then
to just as a, at a certain point,

18
00:00:51,061 --> 00:00:54,900
Twitter becomes so powerful in influencing
elections and giving access to even

19
00:00:54,901 --> 00:00:58,200
the president's tweets that you should
allow people to use the platform based

20
00:00:58,201 --> 00:01:02,250
under the norms of US law,
First Amendment, free speech,

21
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:06,480
the right to expression on the platform.
This is becoming too much, uh, of uh,

22
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,140
it's becoming too powerful and how
our elections are, are taking place.

23
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:13,290
So even if you are saying,
well, hate speeches,

24
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:17,100
our role in a lot of people agree with
that. If at any 0.1 person disagrees,

25
00:01:17,101 --> 00:01:19,160
they're still an American who
has a right to this, you know,

26
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:23,280
to access to the public discourse and
you've essentially monopolize that and not

27
00:01:23,281 --> 00:01:24,750
completely,
but for the most part.

28
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:29,100
So isn't there some responsibility on
you to guarantee at at a certain extent,

29
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:32,430
less regulation happen,
right? Like, look, if you,

30
00:01:32,431 --> 00:01:35,340
if you recognize foreign governments
are manipulating our elections,

31
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:38,880
then shouldn't you guarantee the right
to an American to access this platform to

32
00:01:38,881 --> 00:01:40,200
be involved in the electoral process?

33
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:45,980
I'm not sure I see the, the,
the tie between those things,

34
00:01:45,981 --> 00:01:49,100
but I will address one of your
points, which was, uh, we're not,

35
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:52,930
we're a platform that serves the
world. So we're a global, uh,

36
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,770
75% of the users of Twitter or outside
of the United States. Oh, right, right,

37
00:01:57,771 --> 00:01:59,700
right. So we don't, uh,

38
00:01:59,701 --> 00:02:04,040
apply laws of Jess one country when we're
thinking about it and we think about,

39
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:04,550
um,

40
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:09,350
how do you have a global standard
that can meet the threshold of as many

41
00:02:09,351 --> 00:02:12,380
countries as possible because we want
all the people in the world to be able to

42
00:02:12,381 --> 00:02:13,730
participate in this conversation.

43
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:17,910
Some elections like the Indian election
coming up as well. Right. And I'm, I'm, I,

44
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,710
my understanding is you were also accused
of being biased against conservatives

45
00:02:20,711 --> 00:02:21,544
in India recently.

46
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:25,690
There was a report on that as well as
you held up a sign that said something

47
00:02:25,691 --> 00:02:30,670
offensive about the Brahman
[inaudible]. Yeah. So in that sense,

48
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:32,350
even in other countries,

49
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:34,840
you're accused of the same things that
you're being accused of by American

50
00:02:34,841 --> 00:02:36,080
conservatives.
Okay.

51
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:39,930
I think there, those situations
are very, very different. Um,

52
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:44,230
and I don't think that that the ideologies
in play are the same at all. Well,

53
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:48,410
so the, the reason everyone, can
we clarify that? [inaudible] I,

54
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,950
I'm not sure what you're talking about,

55
00:02:49,951 --> 00:02:53,910
but we did have our vice president public
policy testified in front of Indian

56
00:02:53,911 --> 00:02:55,800
parliament a couple of
weeks ago and he was,

57
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:59,860
they were really focused on election
integrity and safety and abuse, harassment

58
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,070
of women in political figures
in the likes. So, so my, my,

59
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,250
my concern I guess is
I recognize your globe.

60
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,540
You're a company that serves the world,

61
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:12,100
but as an American I have a concern that
the democracy I live in the Democratic

62
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,110
Republic, I'm sorry, in the
democratic functions are healthy.

63
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:18,010
One of the biggest threats is, you
know, Russia, Iran, Russia, Iran, China,

64
00:03:18,011 --> 00:03:20,170
they're trying to meddle in our
elections using your platform.

65
00:03:20,171 --> 00:03:23,110
And it's effective. So much so that you've
actually come out and removed money.

66
00:03:23,111 --> 00:03:26,920
People, you know, Covington was apparently
started by account base in Brazil.

67
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:27,371
You know,

68
00:03:27,371 --> 00:03:31,510
the Covington scandal where this fake
news goes viral was reported by CNN.

69
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:33,040
That was,
it was a dummy account.

70
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:35,710
They were trying to prop it up and they
were pushing out this out of context

71
00:03:35,711 --> 00:03:38,740
information. So they do this,
they use your platform to do it.

72
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:44,300
You've now got a platform that is so
powerful in our American discourse that

73
00:03:44,771 --> 00:03:47,290
foreign governments are using
it as weapons against us.

74
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:51,430
And you've taken a stance against
the laws of the United States.

75
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:53,860
I don't mean like against like
you're breaking the law. I mean you,

76
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:57,070
you have rules that go beyond the scope
of the u s which will restrict American

77
00:03:57,071 --> 00:03:59,080
citizens from being able to participate.
Meanwhile,

78
00:03:59,081 --> 00:04:02,080
foreign actors are free to do so,
so long as they play by your rules.

79
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:06,160
So our elections are being threatened
by the fact that if there's an American

80
00:04:06,161 --> 00:04:08,950
citizen who says, I do not believe
in your mis-gendering policy,

81
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:12,550
and you bend them, that person has been
removed from public discourse on Twitter.

82
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,970
Right? But they don't get banned
for saying they don't agree with it.

83
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,520
Getting him for sure specifically
violating it by targeting an individual,

84
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:22,750
let's say in protest and
individual repeatedly says, no,

85
00:04:22,751 --> 00:04:25,960
I refuse to use your pronouns in like
Megan Murphy's case. And she's Canadian,

86
00:04:25,961 --> 00:04:27,130
so I don't want to use her specifically.

87
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:29,410
The point I'm trying to
make is at a certain level,

88
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,980
there are going to be American citizens
who have been removed from this public

89
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:35,050
discourse,
which has become so absurdly powerful.

90
00:04:35,051 --> 00:04:38,380
Foreign governments weaponize it because
you have different rules than the

91
00:04:38,381 --> 00:04:42,610
American country has. Just to
be clear, my understanding,

92
00:04:42,611 --> 00:04:44,260
and I'm not expert on all the platforms,

93
00:04:44,261 --> 00:04:45,820
is that foreign governments use multiple,

94
00:04:45,821 --> 00:04:50,410
multiple different ways to interfere
in elections and not limited to our

95
00:04:50,411 --> 00:04:53,870
platform, nor is that limited to social
media. But the president design Twitter,

96
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:57,300
right president is on a lot of different
platforms as is the White House. Uh,

97
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:00,370
I think it's fair to point out the
media coverage of his Twitter account is

98
00:05:00,371 --> 00:05:05,080
insane and they run a new stories every
time he tweets and certainly undeniable.

99
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:09,310
I'm just pointing out that there are
a number of different avenues and

100
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,610
individuals have choices and how they
use the platform so that you'd have other

101
00:05:12,611 --> 00:05:15,190
platforms,
but he uses Twitter exclusively.

102
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:18,460
And what I'm trying to bring up is that
if Twitter refuses to acknowledge this

103
00:05:18,461 --> 00:05:21,880
problem, you are facing
regulation. I don't, I don't
know if you care about that,

104
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:24,130
but at a certain point,
which problem,

105
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:28,180
if you're going to restrict American
citizens from participating on a platform

106
00:05:28,181 --> 00:05:31,390
or even the president speaks and
it's essentially you have a private,

107
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:33,160
privately owned public space,

108
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:37,810
as if I could use an analogy that would
be most apt and you've set rules that

109
00:05:37,811 --> 00:05:41,800
are not recognized by the u s in fact,
when it came to a supreme court hearing,

110
00:05:41,801 --> 00:05:44,710
they said, hate speech is not a violation.
It's actually protected free speech.

111
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:48,100
So there's an actual odds.
So there might be someone who says,

112
00:05:48,101 --> 00:05:51,640
I refuse to live by any other means than,
uh, what the Supreme Court sat down.

113
00:05:51,641 --> 00:05:53,830
That means I have a right to hate speech.
You will bend them.

114
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,470
That means your platform is so powerful.
It's,

115
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:00,320
it's being used to manipulate elections
and you have rules that are not

116
00:06:00,321 --> 00:06:03,170
recognized by the government to remove
American citizens from that discourse.

117
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:04,460
So as a private platform,

118
00:06:04,461 --> 00:06:08,960
you've become too powerful to not be
regulated if you refuse to allow people

119
00:06:08,961 --> 00:06:09,794
free speech.

120
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:14,700
But, um, I'm trying to pick
apart, um, the connection.

121
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,980
I think so, yes, we,

122
00:06:18,981 --> 00:06:21,210
we do have an issue with,
um,

123
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,210
foreign entities and misinformation and,

124
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:28,320
and this is a extremely complicated issue,

125
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:33,060
which we're just beginning to
understand and grasp and take action on.

126
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,310
I,

127
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:39,310
I don't think that issue is solved
purely by not being more aggressive on

128
00:06:42,181 --> 00:06:46,080
something else that is taking people
off the platform entirely as well,

129
00:06:46,081 --> 00:06:48,210
which is abuse and harassment.

130
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:53,780
It's a cost benefit analysis ultimately
in our rules are designed again and you

131
00:06:55,071 --> 00:06:57,720
know, they don't always manifest
this way in the outcomes,

132
00:06:57,721 --> 00:07:02,040
but in terms of what we're trying to
drive is opportunity for every single

133
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:05,520
person to be able to speak
freely on the platform.

134
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:10,110
That's absolutely not true. You would
done a lightspeed allow hate speech.

135
00:07:10,111 --> 00:07:13,260
So free speech is not on your platform.
I said,

136
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:18,860
speak for enable everyone that create
the opportunity for everyone to speak on

137
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:22,020
our service unless they've all right.

138
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:24,130
And then in part of that,

139
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:28,360
the recognition that we're taking action
on is that when some people encounter

140
00:07:28,361 --> 00:07:33,361
particular conduct that we see them
wanting to remove themselves from the

141
00:07:34,421 --> 00:07:35,380
platform completely,

142
00:07:35,381 --> 00:07:39,610
which goes against that
principle of enabling everyone
to speak or giving people

143
00:07:39,611 --> 00:07:40,630
the opportunity to speak.

144
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:45,640
Our rules are focused on the
the opportunities presented
and we have particular

145
00:07:46,421 --> 00:07:48,490
outcomes to make sure that
those opportunities are

146
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:50,630
soldier as possible. Let's,
let's separate the first I,

147
00:07:50,631 --> 00:07:54,020
the point I made about foreign
governments was just to explain the, the,

148
00:07:54,021 --> 00:07:57,080
the power that your platform holds.
How can be weaponized?

149
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:58,103
We'll separate that now.

150
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:02,150
When antifa shows up to Berkeley and
bashes a guy over there with a bike lock

151
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,870
that is suppressing his
speech, right? That's an act
of physical violence. However,

152
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,260
when Auntie fall links hands and blocks
the door so that no one can go to an

153
00:08:09,261 --> 00:08:12,050
event that is also legally allowed,
right?

154
00:08:12,051 --> 00:08:15,470
So what you're saying is that if someone
is engaging in behavior such as going

155
00:08:15,471 --> 00:08:18,230
on Twitter and shouting
someone down relentlessly,

156
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:21,200
that's something external
to what happens in, in,

157
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:22,580
in the world under the u s government.

158
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:27,380
I am allowed to scream very close to
you and not let you speak in public,

159
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:29,060
but on Twitter you don't allow that.

160
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:31,970
So there's a dramatic difference between
what Twitter thinks is okay and what

161
00:08:31,971 --> 00:08:33,290
the u s government thinks is okay.

162
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,270
Our democracy functions
and how Twitter functions.

163
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:39,710
The issue I'm pointing out is that
we know Twitter is becoming extremely

164
00:08:39,711 --> 00:08:41,960
important in how our public
discourse is occurring,

165
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:45,170
how our cultural culture is
developing and who even gets elected.

166
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:49,220
So if you have rules that
are based on a global policy,

167
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:53,360
that means American citizens who are
abiding by all of the laws of our country

168
00:08:53,361 --> 00:08:55,740
are being restricted from engaging
in public discourse because you've

169
00:08:55,741 --> 00:08:57,510
monopolized it.
Can I counter that though?

170
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,210
Because these foreign governments
are restricted by the same rules.

171
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:03,480
So if they violate those same rules,
they will be, they will be removed.

172
00:09:03,481 --> 00:09:05,160
So play within those rules.

173
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:08,460
They can participate in the discourse
even if they are just trying to manipulate

174
00:09:08,461 --> 00:09:10,560
our elections.
On the other hand,

175
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:14,550
if the people that are on the
platform play by those rules,

176
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:19,350
they can also counteract unless
their ideology goes in line with us.

177
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:22,020
Law and it's legally allowed
as opposed to what you allow.

178
00:09:22,021 --> 00:09:26,070
So foreign governments can can absolutely
keep making new accounts and keep

179
00:09:26,071 --> 00:09:27,390
bottling and keep manipulating.

180
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:30,300
They can even post things that'll go
viral and then get banned and not care.

181
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:33,210
Right. But a private American
citizen can say, here's my opinion,

182
00:09:33,211 --> 00:09:35,490
I refuse to back down. I see what
you're saying. You will ban him.

183
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:40,210
So we can see that at a certain
point you have a lot your, your,

184
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,750
your Twitter is slowly gaining in,
in my opinion,

185
00:09:42,751 --> 00:09:46,680
too much control from your personal
ideology based on what you've researched,

186
00:09:46,681 --> 00:09:51,090
what you think is right over American
discourse. If you, if Twitter,

187
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:52,770
and this again is my opinion,
I'm not a lawmaker,

188
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:58,130
but I would have to assume if Twitter
refuses to say in the United States you

189
00:09:59,071 --> 00:10:01,710
are allowed to say what is
legally acceptable period.

190
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:05,250
Then lawmakers only choice will be to
enforce regulation on your company.

191
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:06,141
Actually tell him,

192
00:10:06,141 --> 00:10:09,250
I spent quite a bit of time talking
to lawmakers as part of my role,

193
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:12,610
had a public policy. Um, I
spent a lot of time in DC.

194
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:17,230
I want to say the Jack and I have both
spent a lot of time in DC and I think

195
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:19,780
from the perspective of of lawmakers,

196
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:25,630
they across the spectrum are
also in favor of policing,

197
00:10:25,631 --> 00:10:28,150
abuse and harassment
online and bullying online.

198
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:32,620
Those are things that people care about
because they affect their children if

199
00:10:32,621 --> 00:10:35,080
they affect their communities
and they fact individuals.

200
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:38,560
And so I don't think that,
and as a,

201
00:10:38,561 --> 00:10:40,510
as a private American business,

202
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:45,280
we can have different standards than
what an American government owned

203
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:48,550
corporations or American
government would have to institute.

204
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,850
Those are two different things,
American bit.

205
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:54,070
And I understand your point about the
influence and I'm not denying that.

206
00:10:54,071 --> 00:10:58,330
Certainly Twitter is an influential
platform, but like anything,

207
00:10:58,331 --> 00:11:02,110
whether it's the American law or the
rules of Twitter or the rules of Facebook

208
00:11:02,111 --> 00:11:05,620
or wills of any platform, there are rules
and those rules have to be followed.

209
00:11:05,621 --> 00:11:09,040
So it is your choice whether to
follow those rules and to continue to

210
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:12,690
participate in a civic dialogue.
And it's your choice to not do that.

211
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:13,341
Absolutely.

212
00:11:13,341 --> 00:11:17,180
You've monopolized public discourse to
an extreme degree and you say my way or

213
00:11:17,181 --> 00:11:17,870
the highway

214
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:20,300
we are facing Tim,
we haven't monopolize it.

215
00:11:20,301 --> 00:11:23,720
There are many different avenues for
people to continue to have a voice.

216
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:27,830
There are many different platforms that
offer that we are a largely influential

217
00:11:27,831 --> 00:11:30,440
line. I'm not trying to take away from
that and we're a very important one.

218
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,820
You don't need to be the most important.

219
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:35,540
It's just that you are extremely important
and that's, and it's a compliment.

220
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:37,460
Twitter has become extremely powerful,

221
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:41,040
but at a certain point you should not
have the right to control what people are

222
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:44,490
allowed to say. No private or
outlook. I'm a social liberal.

223
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:48,330
I think we should regulate
you guys because you are
unelected officials running

224
00:11:48,331 --> 00:11:52,290
your system the way you see fit against
the wishes of a democratic republic.

225
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,450
And there are who disagree with you
or being excised from public discourse

226
00:11:55,451 --> 00:11:57,970
because of your ideology.
That terrifies me.

227
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:00,700
And we can take it one step
further just so I understand.

228
00:12:00,701 --> 00:12:05,380
So are you suggesting that we don't
have any policies around abuse and

229
00:12:05,381 --> 00:12:07,660
harassment on the platform?
Um,

230
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:10,120
I'm trying to understand what it
is you're saying cause I'm not,

231
00:12:10,121 --> 00:12:11,320
I'm not sure I'm following you.

232
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:14,290
So you don't think we should have
any rules about abuse and harassment.

233
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:17,680
So even though the threats that you
received that you mentioned that we did,

234
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:21,850
but you mentioned a number of threats
that you received in your quite frustrated

235
00:12:21,851 --> 00:12:24,280
that we hadn't taken action on them,
that you think we shouldn't have roles.

236
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:28,360
That I'm frustrated because of
the hypocrisy. When I, when I see,

237
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,560
I see the flow of one direction and then
what I see are Republican politicians

238
00:12:32,561 --> 00:12:34,990
who in my opinion are just too ignorant
to understand what the hell's going on

239
00:12:34,991 --> 00:12:35,770
around them.

240
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:40,510
And I see people burning signs that
say free speech Icu openly saying we

241
00:12:40,511 --> 00:12:44,260
recognize the power of our platform and
we're not going to abide by American

242
00:12:44,261 --> 00:12:49,060
norms. I see the manipulation of Twitter
for uh, in violation of our elections.

243
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:53,830
I see democratic operatives in Alabama
waging a false flag campaign using fake

244
00:12:53,831 --> 00:12:55,500
Russian accounts and the,
and the,

245
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:58,990
and the guy who runs that company has
not been banned from your platform even

246
00:12:58,991 --> 00:13:01,300
after it's been written by the
New York Times. He was doing this.

247
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,720
So we know that not only are
people manipulating your platform,

248
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:08,950
you have rules that remove honest American
citizens with bad opinions who have a

249
00:13:08,951 --> 00:13:10,480
right to engage in public discourse.

250
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:14,680
And it's like you recognize it
but you like having the power.

251
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,140
I'm not quite sure at what point,
get back to my point.

252
00:13:17,141 --> 00:13:21,310
So you believe that Twitter should not
have any rules about abuse and harassment

253
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:24,290
or any sort of hate speech on the
platform that that's your position.

254
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:28,600
That's a extremely productive, I don't
know that maybe, maybe too simplistic.

255
00:13:28,601 --> 00:13:31,360
The point I'm trying to make is,
but that would have you ain't,

256
00:13:31,361 --> 00:13:32,011
you're trying to make your,

257
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:36,580
you're asking us to comply with the u
s law that would criminalize potential

258
00:13:36,581 --> 00:13:40,090
speech and put people in jail for it.
And you're asking us to enforce those,

259
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:44,650
those while, I mean, if you insight
death, you will, it's a crime. You can go,

260
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:48,410
you can go to jail for that. So at the
very least, you could, you like when you,

261
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:50,500
when you have people on your platform who
committed a crime, you don't ban them.

262
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:51,820
I say, well, that's really weird.

263
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:54,310
And then when you have people on your
platform who say a bad, naughty word.
